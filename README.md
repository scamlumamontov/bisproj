The original ER diagram and Use Case diagram were created as part of the project presentation.
Due to file loss, the diagram source files are no longer available in this repository.

Both diagrams can be found in the project presentation, slide 7, which is included in the repository.

They describe:

the main entities and their relationships (ER diagram)

the main user interactions with the system (Use Case diagram)
